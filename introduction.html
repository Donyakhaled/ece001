<h2>introduction:</h2>
Computer programming language, 
any of various languages for expressing a set of detailed instructions for a digital computer.
 Such instructions can be executed directly when they are in the computer manufacturer-specific numerical 
 form known as machine language, after a simple substitution process when expressed in a corresponding assembly language, 
 or after translation from some “higher-level” language.
 Although there are many computer languages, relatively few are widely used.
 
 Modern human life is greatly influenced by computers. And the computer is run by a computer program.
 Computer programs are arranged by programming languages, therefore they are the basis of all the conveniences that we feel. 
 Programming languages are responsible for all programs that have been made; rostering systems, virtual reality, scheduling software, online games, Uber app, anti-virus and so on.
 Thus mastering programming languages brings one closer to understanding how all digital technology originates.
 This article will highlight the importance of programming languages.
